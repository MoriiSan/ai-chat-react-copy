      content: "Plugging your mouse in might seem obvious, but it accounts for a lot of mouse issues. Even if your mouse seems to be plugged in correctly, it may not be. That's because some computer mice need adapters or dongles to function. If you’ve plugged in a new mouse and it’s not responsive, read the hardware requirements to make sure you have the right connectors and cables. This is true for some wireless mice, too. If your wireless mouse is not working, the wireless receiver may have come unplugged from your computer. Or, you may need an adaptor for it to work properly."
